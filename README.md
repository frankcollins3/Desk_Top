Problem solving UI that fixes the deciding between:
1) nice desktop bg
2) list of things worth mentioning

[desktop_bg_img]list_of_txt] and allows for UI to accommodate both goals

cheesy play on words that one could see things at a more TOP level from the Desktop by having important info or reminders taking up half the screen. 

// as I type this I realize these are tasks that could be handled by C programming as well https://github.com/frankcollins3/settings simple repo about [machine||user]setting interaction with C

// bookmark interesting if possible: link this up to a node APP and have npm i puppeteer look for images from the web and communicate that image path to a C program to assert path as desktop bg
